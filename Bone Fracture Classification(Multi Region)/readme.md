## Introduction

Bone fractures are a common injury and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the detection and classification of bone fractures in X-ray images, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation includes X-ray images with labeled regions indicating the presence of fractures. Details on how to obtain and preprocess the dataset can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saketjha34/Python-Deep-Learning-Projects.git
cd Python-Deep-Learning-Projects/Bone\ Fracture\ Classification\(Multi\ Region\)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
```

To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config/evaluate_config.yaml
```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the `scripts/` directory, which contains all the necessary scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using convolutional neural networks as ResNet and AlexNet Built from scratch. The architecture details are available in the `model/` directory.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying bone fractures across multiple regions. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `results/` directory.
