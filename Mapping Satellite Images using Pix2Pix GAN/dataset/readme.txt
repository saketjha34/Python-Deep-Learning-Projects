About Dataset:
"Mapping Satellite Images: A Comprehensive Dataset"

This dataset is designed for the task of mapping satellite images to corresponding map representations using advanced techniques like pix2pix GANs. It is structured to facilitate training and validation for machine learning models, providing a robust foundation for image-to-image translation projects.

Dataset Structure
Main Directory: maps
Train Folder: Contains 1096 training images
Val Folder: Contains 1098 validation images
Image Details
Dimensions: Each image is 1200x600 pixels (width x height)
Content:
The left half (600x600 pixels) is the satellite image
The right half (600x600 pixels) is the corresponding map image, serving as the target for the satellite image

Usage
This dataset is ideal for developing and testing models that perform image translation from satellite photos to map images, supporting various applications in remote sensing, urban planning, and geographic information systems (GIS).
